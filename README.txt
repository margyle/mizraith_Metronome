METRONOME PROJECT README

The metronome project was created for Calico Music Studio. and the 
source code is provided free of charge.  Use is unrestricted, however
I ask you you cite author and source link (see code) should you 
make use of the code.


TO BUILD: 
 (1) Unzip "library_files.zip". Inside you will find original and third-party
 libraries required to build the code.
 (2) Move those libraries to wherever your Arduino applicaiton expects to find library files.
